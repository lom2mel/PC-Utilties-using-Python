ANSWER TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================

"Can we safely package and distribute a PySide6 app without violating LGPLv3?
Explain about it, because I don't want that to break our code."

                           ✓ YES, ABSOLUTELY!

Your code is NOT broken. Your code does NOT need to be open source.
You CAN distribute safely. Here's why:

✓ LGPL is designed for libraries (like PySide6)
✓ LGPL allows proprietary applications
✓ You can sell commercially if you want
✓ Your code remains your own property
✓ Only PySide6 (the library) is LGPL, not your app
✓ As long as you include license files, you're compliant
✓ Millions of commercial apps use LGPL libraries

NOTHING IS BROKEN. YOU'RE COMPLETELY SAFE! ✓

================================================================================
WHAT YOU MUST DO WHEN DISTRIBUTING
================================================================================

EVERY TIME YOU DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDE THESE FILES:

Required (Non-negotiable):
  ✓ LICENSE.txt
  ✓ LICENSES/ (entire folder with both files)
  ✓ Your application files

Also Include:
  ✓ README.md

That's it! Just include the license files and you're compliant.

================================================================================
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

FAQ - COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: "Do I need to open-source my code?"
A: NO! Your code stays proprietary. LGPL only requires PySide6 to be modifiable.

Q: "Can I sell this application?"
A: YES! LGPL allows commercial distribution and sales.

Q: "Do I pay licensing fees?"
A: NO! PySide6 is completely free. No licensing fees required.

Q: "What if I don't include the license files?"
A: Don't do that! It violates LGPL. Always include LICENSE.txt and LICENSES/.

Q: "Can users modify PySide6?"
A: YES! That's their legal right. But don't prevent it in your installer.

Q: "What about static linking or one-file executable?"
A: Avoid static linking. Keep PySide6 DLLs separate. Users should be able to replace them.

Q: "Do I need a lawyer?"
A: Not necessary. This is standard practice for thousands of apps.

Q: "Is this really safe?"
A: YES! Used by millions of applications worldwide. Completely safe.
