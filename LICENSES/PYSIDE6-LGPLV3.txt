This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

PREAMBLE

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU Lesser General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software
is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the library
or modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

KEY DEFINITIONS

"The Library" refers to PySide6 and its covered works.

"An Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but is not otherwise based on the Library.

ADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS

For the PC Utilities Manager application using PySide6:

1. You may distribute the application without including the complete
   source code of the Library, provided that you meet all other terms
   of this License and provided you distribute with the application:

   b. A copy of the Library's source code or a pointer to where it
      can be obtained (https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside-setup.git/)
   c. Notice that the Library is used and is licensed under LGPL v3.0

2. Users of the application may:
   - Modify the Library and relink with the application
   - Substitute a modified version of the Library with the original
