COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: "If I include all these license files, won't people steal my code?"
A: No! Your app code stays yours. Only PySide6 (the GUI library) is LGPL.
   The license files actually PROTECT your interests by being transparent.

Q: "Do I lose any rights by using LGPL libraries?"
A: No! LGPL is designed specifically to allow proprietary software.
   Only if you modify PySide6 itself do you need to share those changes.

Q: "What if someone complains about the license?"
A: You're protected! You have all required documents. Show them LICENSE.txt.
   This is industry standard. Used by thousands of commercial applications.

Q: "Should I hire a lawyer to check this?"
A: Not necessary, but if you want peace of mind, you can.
   This is standard practice. Nothing unusual or risky here.

Q: "What if I want to remove the About dialog attribution?"
A: You can't remove it (LGPL requirement), but you can improve it!
   Make it more prominent or informative if you want.

Q: "Can I change the license files?"
A: No, the LGPL text must be unchanged. But you can add YOUR license on top.

Q: "What about future updates?"
A: Same process for each version. Include the same license files.
