     - `README.md`

2. **Right-click `auto_setup.bat` and select "Run as administrator"**
   - That's it! The script will automatically:
     - ✓ Download the latest Python installer from python.org
     - ✓ Install Python with "Add to PATH" enabled
     - ✓ Install all required dependencies (PySide6, pywin32, Pillow)
     - ✓ Launch the application

**Note**: Administrator privileges are required to install Python system-wide and configure PATH.

### Method 2: Quick Install (If Python is already installed)

1. **Copy the entire folder to your USB drive or target PC**
   - Make sure these files are included:
     - `download_manager.py`

   - Wait for all dependencies to install
   - The script will install:
     - PySide6 (GUI framework)
     - pywin32 (Windows COM automation for Office conversion)
     - Pillow (Image processing for PDF conversion)

4. **Launch the application**
   - Double-click `run.bat`
   - OR run: `python download_manager.py`

### Method 3: Manual Installation
