TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q: "I don't see the LICENSES folder"
A: It should be in your project directory. Check for LICENSES/ folder.

Q: "Which files must I include?"
A: Minimum: app files + LICENSE.txt + LICENSES/ folder. See above.

Q: "Can I delete the distribution guides?"
A: Yes, they're for reference. But keep LICENSE.txt and LICENSES/ folder.

Q: "What if I distribute without licenses?"
A: Don't! It violates LGPL. Always include them.

Q: "Can I modify the license text?"
A: No. The LGPL text must be unmodified. Your own content can vary.

Q: "What about future versions?"
A: Same process. Include the same license files with each release.
